= Vertx unit

Asynchronous polyglot unit testing.

== Introduction

Vertx Unit is designed for writing asynchronous unit tests with a polyglot API and running these tests
in the JVM. Vertx Unit Api borrows from existing test frameworks like http://junit.org[JUnit] or http://qunitjs.com[QUnit]
and follows the Vert.x practices.

As a consequence Vertx Unit is the natural choice for testing Vert.x applications.

To use vert.x unit, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-unit</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile io.vertx:vertx-unit:3.2.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Vert.x unit can be used in different ways and run anywhere your code runs, it is just a matter of reporting
the results the right way, this example shows the bare minimum test suite:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  s = "value"
  context.assert_equals("value", s)
}
suite.run()

----

The `run` method will execute the suite and go through all the
tests of the suite. The suite can fail or pass, this does not matter if the outer world is not aware
of the test result.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  s = "value"
  context.assert_equals("value", s)
}
suite.run({
  'reporters' => [
    {
      'to' => "console"
    }
  ]
})

----

When executed, the test suite now reports to the console the steps of the test suite:

----
Begin test suite the_test_suite
Begin test my_test
Passed my_test
End test suite the_test_suite , run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
----

The `reporters` option configures the reporters used by the suite runner for reporting the execution
of the tests, see the <<reporting>> section for more info.

== Writing a test suite

A test suite is a named collection of test case, a test case is a straight callback to execute. The suite can
have lifecycle callbacks to execute _before_ and/or _after_ the test cases or the test suite that are used for
initializing or disposing services used by the test suite.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.test("my_test_case_1") { |context|
  # Test 1
}
suite.test("my_test_case_2") { |context|
  # Test 2
}
suite.test("my_test_case_3") { |context|
  # Test 3
}

----

The API is fluent and therefore the test cases can be chained:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.test("my_test_case_1") { |context|
  # Test 1
}.test("my_test_case_2") { |context|
  # Test 2
}.test("my_test_case_3") { |context|
  # Test 3
}

----

The test cases declaration order is not guaranteed, so test cases should not rely on the execution of
another test case to run. Such practice is considered as a bad one.

Vertx Unit provides _before_ and _after_ callbacks for doing global setup or cleanup:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.before() { |context|
  # Test suite setup
}.test("my_test_case_1") { |context|
  # Test 1
}.test("my_test_case_2") { |context|
  # Test 2
}.test("my_test_case_3") { |context|
  # Test 3
}.after() { |context|
  # Test suite cleanup
}

----

The declaration order of the method does not matter, the example declares the _before_ callback before
the test cases and _after_ callback after the test cases but it could be anywhere, as long as it is done before
running the test suite.

The _before_ callback is executed before any tests, when it fails, the test suite execution will stop and the
failure is reported. The _after_ callback is the last callback executed by the testsuite, unless
the _before_ callback reporter a failure.

Likewise, Vertx Unit provides the _beforeEach_ and _afterEach_ callback that do the same but are executed
for each test case:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.before_each() { |context|
  # Test case setup
}.test("my_test_case_1") { |context|
  # Test 1
}.test("my_test_case_2") { |context|
  # Test 2
}.test("my_test_case_3") { |context|
  # Test 3
}.after_each() { |context|
  # Test case cleanup
}

----

The _beforeEach_ callback is executed before each test case, when it fails, the test case is not executed and the
failure is reported. The _afterEach_ callback is the executed just after the test case callback, unless
the _beforeEach_ callback reported a failure.

== Asserting

Vertx Unit provides the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html[TestContext]` object for doing assertions in test cases. The _context_
object provides the usual methods when dealing with assertions.

=== assertEquals

Assert two objects are equals, works for _basic_ types or _json_ types.

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_equals(10, callbackCount)
}

----

There is also an overloaded version for providing a message:

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_equals(10, callbackCount, "Should have been 10 instead of #{callbackCount}")
}

----

Usually each assertion provides an overloaded version.

=== assertNotEquals

The counter part of _assertEquals_.

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_not_equals(10, callbackCount)
}

----

=== assertNull

Assert an object is null, works for _basic_ types or _json_ types.

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_null(nil)
}

----

=== assertNotNull

The counter part of _assertNull_.

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_not_null("not null!")
}

----

=== assertInRange

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#assert_in_range-instance_method[assertInRange]` targets real numbers.

----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|

  # Assert that 0.1 is equals to 0.2 +/- 0.5

  context.assert_in_range(0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
}

----

=== assertTrue and assertFalse

Asserts the value of a boolean expression.

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.assert_true(var)
  context.assert_false(value > 10)
}

----

=== Failing

Last but not least, _test_ provides a _fail_ method that will throw an assertion error:

[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  context.fail("That should never happen")
  # Following statements won't be executed
}

----

The failure can either be a _string_ as seen previously or an _error_. The _error_ object depends
on the target language, for Java or Groovy it can be any class extending _Throwable- , for
JavaScript it is an _error_, for Ruby it is an _Exception_.

== Asynchronous testing

The previous examples supposed that test cases were terminated after their respective callbacks, this is the
default behavior of a test case callback. Often it is desirable to terminate the test after the test case
callback, for instance:

.The Async object asynchronously completes the test case
[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  async = context.async()
  eventBus.consumer("the-address") { |msg|
    # <2>
    async.complete()
  }
  # <1>
}

----
<1> The callback exits but the test case is not terminated
<2> The event callback from the bus terminates the test

Creating an `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]` object with the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#async-instance_method[async]` method marks the
executed test case as non terminated. The test case terminates when the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html#complete-instance_method[complete]`
method is invoked.

NOTE: When the `complete` callback is not invoked, the test case fails after a certain timeout.

Several `Async` objects can be created during the same test case, all of them must be _completed_ to terminate
the test.

.Several Async objects provide coordination
[source,ruby]
----
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|

  async1 = context.async()
  client = vertx.create_http_client()
  req = client.get(8080, "localhost", "/")
  req.exception_handler() { |err|
    context.fail(err.get_message())
  }
  req.handler() { |resp|
    context.assert_equals(200, resp.status_code())
    async1.complete()
  }
  req.end()

  async2 = context.async()
  vertx.event_bus().consumer("the-address") { |msg|
    async2.complete()
  }
}

----

Async objects can also be used in _before_ or _after_ callbacks, it can be very convenient in a _before_ callback
to implement a setup that depends on one or several asynchronous results:

.Async starts an http server before test cases
[source,ruby]
----
suite.before() { |context|
  async = context.async()
  server = vertx.create_http_server()
  server.request_handler(&requestHandler)
  server.listen(8080) { |ar_err,ar|
    context.assert_true(ar_err == nil)
    async.complete()
  }
}

----

It is possible to wait until the completion of a specific `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]`, similar
to Java's count-down latch:

.Wait for completion
[source, ruby]
----
async = context.async()
server = vertx.create_http_server()
server.request_handler(&requestHandler)
server.listen(8080) { |ar_err,ar|
  context.assert_true(ar_err == nil)
  async.complete()
}

# Wait until completion
async.await_success()

# Do something else

----

WARNING: this should not be executed from the event loop!

Async can also be created with an initial count value, it completes when the count-down reaches
zero using `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html#count_down-instance_method[countDown]`:

.Wait until the complete count-down reaches zero
[source, ruby]
----
async = context.async(2)
server = vertx.create_http_server()
server.request_handler(&requestHandler)
server.listen(8080) { |ar_err,ar|
  context.assert_true(ar_err == nil)
  async.count_down()
}

vertx.set_timer(1000) { |id|
  async.complete()
}

# Wait until completion of the timer and the http request
async.await_success()

# Do something else

----

Calling `complete()` on an async completes the async as usual, it actually sets the value to `0`.

== Repeating test

When a test fails randomly or not often, for instance a race condition, it is convenient to run the same
test multiple times to increase the failure likelihood of the test.

.Repeating a test
[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("my_suite").test("my_test", 1000) { |context|
  # This will be executed 1000 times
}

----

When declared, _beforeEach_ and _afterEach_ callbacks will be executed as many times as the test is executed.

NOTE: test repetition are executed sequentially

== Sharing objects

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html[TestContext]` has `get`/`put`/`remove` operations for sharing state between callbacks.

Any object added during the _before_ callback is available in any other callbacks. Each test case will operate on
a copy of the shared state, so updates will only be visible for a test case.

.Sharing state between callbacks
[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("my_suite").before() { |context|

  # host is available for all test cases
  context.put("host", "localhost")

}.before_each() { |context|

  # Generate a random port for each test
  port = helper.random_port()

  # Get host
  host = context.get("host")

  # Setup server
  async = context.async()
  server = vertx.create_http_server()
  server.request_handler() { |req|
    req.response().set_status_code(200).end()
  }
  server.listen(port, host) { |ar_err,ar|
    context.assert_true(ar_err == nil)
    context.put("port", port)
    async.complete()
  }

}.test("my_test") { |context|

  # Get the shared state
  port = context.get("port")
  host = context.get("host")

  # Do request
  client = vertx.create_http_client()
  req = client.get(port, host, "/resource")
  async = context.async()
  req.handler() { |resp|
    context.assert_equals(200, resp.status_code())
    async.complete()
  }
  req.end()
}

----

WARNING: sharing any object is only supported in Java, other languages can share only basic or json types.
Other objects should be shared using the features of that language.

== Running

When a test suite is created, it won't be executed until the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestSuite.html#run-instance_method[run]` method
is called.

.Running a test suite
[source,ruby]
----
suite.run()

----

The test suite can also be run with a specified `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/Vertx.html[Vertx]` instance:

.Provides a Vertx instance to run the test suite
[source,ruby]
----
suite.run(vertx)

----

When running with a `Vertx` instance, the test suite is executed using the Vertx event loop, see the <<eventloop>>
section for more details.

A test suite can be run with the Vert.x Command Line Interface with the `vertx test` command:

.Running a test suite with the Vert.x CLI
[source]
----
> vertx test the_test_suite.js
Begin test suite the_test_suite
Succeeded in deploying verticle
Begin test my_test_case
Passed my_test_case
End test suite my_suite , run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0
----

Such test suite just need to be executed via the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestSuite.html#run-instance_method[run]` command, the
`vertx test` command takes care of configuring reporting, timeout, etc..., pretty much like in this
example:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/test_suite'
suite = VertxUnit::TestSuite.create("the_test_suite")
suite.test("my_test_case") { |context|
  s = "value"
  context.assert_equals("value", s)
}
suite.run()

----

The `vertx test` command extends the `vertx run` command. The exit behavior of the JVM is changed
the JVM exits when the test suite is executed and a return value is provided indicating the tests
success (0) or failure (1).

NOTE: several test suites can executed in the same verticle, Vert.x Unit waits until completion of
all suite executed.

=== Test suite completion

No assumptions can be made about when the test suite will be completed, and if some code needs to be executed
after the test suite, it should either be in the test suite _after_ callback or as callback of the
`link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Completion.html[Completion]`:

.Test suite execution callback
[source,ruby]
----
completion = suite.run(vertx)

# Simple completion callback
completion.handler() { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    puts "Test suite passed!"
  else
    puts "Test suite failed:"
    ar_err.print_stack_trace()
  end
}

----

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Completion.html[Completion]` object provides also a `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Completion.html#resolve-instance_method[resolve]` method that
takes a `Future` object, this `Future` will be notified of the test suite execution:

.Resolving the start Future with the test suite
[source,ruby]
----
completion = suite.run()

# When the suite completes, the future is resolved
completion.resolve(startFuture)

----

This allow to easily create a _test_ verticle whose deployment is the test suite execution, allowing the
code that deploys it to be easily aware of the success or failure.

The completion object can also be used like a latch to block until the test suite completes. This should
be used when the thread running the test suite is not the same than the current thread:

.Blocking until the test suite completes
[source,ruby]
----
completion = suite.run()

# Wait until the test suite completes
completion.await()

----

The `await` throws an exception when the thread is interrupted or a timeout is fired.

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Completion.html#await_success-instance_method[awaitSuccess]` is a variation that throws an exception when
the test suite fails.

.Blocking until the test suite succeeds
[source,ruby]
----
completion = suite.run()

# Wait until the test suite succeeds otherwise throw an exception
completion.await_success()

----

=== Time out

Each test case of a test suite must execute before a certain timeout is reached. The default timeout is
of _2 minutes_, it can be changed using _test options_:

.Setting the test suite timeout
[source,ruby]
----
options = {
  'timeout' => 10000
}

# Run with a 10 seconds time out
suite.run(options)

----

[[event_loop]]
=== Event loop

Vertx Unit execution is a list of tasks to execute, the execution of each task is driven by the completion
of the previous task. These tasks should leverage Vert.x event loop when possible but that depends on the
current execution context (i.e the test suite is executed in a `main` or embedded in a `Verticle`) and
wether or not a `Vertx` instance is configured.

The `link:../dataobjects.html#TestOptions#set_use_event_loop-instance_method[useEventLoop]` configures the usage of the event
loop:

.Event loop usage
|===
| | useEventLoop:null | useEventLoop:true | useEventLoop:false

| `Vertx` instance
| use vertx event loop
| use vertx event loop
| force no event loop

| in a `Verticle`
| use current event loop
| use current event loop
| force no event loop

| in a _main_
| use no event loop
| raise an error
| use no event loop

|===

The default `useEventLoop` value is `null`, that means that it will uses an event loop when possible and fallback
to no event loop when no one is available.

== Reporting

Reporting is an important piece of a test suite, Vertx Unit can be configured to run with different kind
of reporters.

By default no reporter is configured, when running a test suite, _test options_ can be provided to
configure one or several:

.Using the console reporter and as a junit xml file
[source,ruby]
----

# Report to console
consoleReport = {
  'to' => "console"
}

# Report junit files to the current directory
junitReport = {
  'to' => "file:.",
  'format' => "junit"
}

suite.run({
  'reporters' => [
    consoleReport,
    junitReport
  ]
})

----

=== Console reporting

Reports to the JVM `System.out` and `System.err`:

to::
_console_
format::
_simple_ or _junit_

=== File reporting

Reports to a file, a `Vertx` instance must be provided:

to::
_file_ `:` _dir name_
format::
_simple_ or _junit_
example::
`file:.`

The file reporter will create files in the configured directory, the files will be named after the
test suite name executed and the format (i.e _simple_ creates _txt_ files and _junit_ creates _xml_
files).

=== Log reporting

Reports to a logger, a `Vertx` instance must be provided:

to::
_log_ `:` _logger name_
example::
`log:mylogger`

=== Event bus reporting

Reports events to the event bus, a `Vertx` instance must be provided:

to::
_bus_ `:` _event bus address_
example::
`bus:the-address`

It allow to decouple the execution of the test suite from the reporting.

The messages sent over the event bus can be collected by the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/EventBusCollector.html[EventBusCollector]`
and achieve custom reporting:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx-unit/event_bus_collector'
collector = VertxUnit::EventBusCollector.create(vertx, {
  'reporters' => [
    {
      'to' => "file:report.xml",
      'format' => "junit"
    }
  ]
})

collector.register("the-address")

----

== Junit integration

Although Vertx Unit is polyglot and not based on JUnit, it is possible to run a Vertx Unit test suite or a test case
from JUnit, allowing you to integrate your tests with JUnit and your build system or IDE.

.Run a Java class as a JUnit test suite
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)
public class JUnitTestSuite {
  @Test
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    context.assertFalse(false);
  }
}

----

The `link:unavailable[VertxUnitRunner]` uses the junit annotations for introspecting the class
and create a test suite after the class. The methods should declare a `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html[TestContext]`
argument, if they don't it is fine too. However the `TestContext` is the only way to retrieve the associated
Vertx instance of perform asynchronous tests.

The JUnit integration is also available for the Groovy language with the `io.vertx.groovy.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner`
runner.

=== Running a test on a Vert.x context

By default the thread invoking the test methods is the JUnit thread. The `link:unavailable[RunTestOnContext]`
JUnit rule can be used to alter this behavior for running these test methods with a Vert.x event loop thread.

Thus there must be some care when state is shared between test methods and Vert.x handlers as they won't be
on the same thread, e.g incrementing a counter in a Vert.x handler and asserting the counter in the test method.
One way to solve this is to use proper synchronization, another is to execute test methods on a Vert.x context
that will be propagated to the created handlers.

For this purpose the `link:unavailable[RunTestOnContext]` rule needs a `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/Vertx.html[Vertx]`
instance. Such instance can be provided, otherwise the rule will manage an instance under the hood. Such
instance can be retrieved when the test is running, making this rule a way to manage a `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/Vertx.html[Vertx]`
instance as well.

.Run a Java class as a JUnit test suite
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.RunTestOnContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)
public class RunOnContextJUnitTestSuite {

  @Rule
  RunTestOnContext rule = new RunTestOnContext();

  @Test
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    // Use the underlying vertx instance
    Vertx vertx = rule.vertx();
  }
}
----

The rule can be annotated by `@Rule` or `@ClassRule`, the former manages a Vert.x instance
per test, the later a single Vert.x for the test methods of the class.

WARNING: keep in mind that you cannot block the event loop when using this rule. Usage of classes like
`CountDownLatch` or similar classes must be done with care.

=== Timeout

The Vert.x Unit 2 minutes timeout can be overriden with the `timeout` member of the `@Test` annotation:

.Configure the timeout at the test level
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;


import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import org.junit.Test;

public class JunitTestWithTimeout {

  @Test(timeout = 1000)
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    //...
  }

}

----

For a more global configuration, the `link:unavailable[Timeout]` rule can be used:

.Configure the timeout at the class level
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.Timeout;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)
public class TimeoutTestSuite {

  @Rule
  public Timeout rule = Timeout.seconds(1);

  @Test
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    //...
  }
}

----

NOTE: the `@Test` timeout overrides the the `link:unavailable[Timeout]` rule.

=== Parameterized tests

JUnit provides useful `Parameterized` tests, Vert.x Unit tests can be ran with this particular runner thanks to
the `link:unavailable[VertxUnitRunnerWithParametersFactory]`:

.Running a Vert.x Unit parameterized test
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunnerWithParametersFactory;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;

import java.util.Arrays;

@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
@Parameterized.UseParametersRunnerFactory(VertxUnitRunnerWithParametersFactory.class)
public class SimpleParameterizedTest {

  @Parameterized.Parameters
  public static Iterable<Integer> data() {
    return Arrays.asList(0, 1, 2);
  }

  public SimpleParameterizedTest(int value) {
    //...
  }

  @Test
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    // Execute test with the current value
  }
}

----

Parameterized tests can also be done in Groovy with the `io.vertx.groovy.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunnerWithParametersFactory`.

=== Repeating a test

When a test fails randomly or not often, for instance a race condition, it is convenient to run the same
test multiple times to increase the likelihood failure of the test.

With JUnit a test has to be annotated with `link:unavailable[@Repeat]` to be repeated. The test must
also define the `link:unavailable[RepeatRule]` among its rules.

.Repeating a test with JUnit
[source,ruby]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.Repeat;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.RepeatRule;
import io.vertx.ext.unit.junit.VertxUnitRunner;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(VertxUnitRunner.class)
public class RepeatingTest {

  @Rule
  RepeatRule rule = new RepeatRule();

  @Repeat(1000)
  @Test
  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    // This will be executed 1000 times
  }
}
----

When declared, _before_ and _after_ life cycle will be executed as many times as the test is executed.

NOTE: test repetition are executed sequentially

== Java language integration

=== Test suite integration

The Java language provides classes and it is possible to create test suites directly from Java classes with the
following mapping rules:

The `testSuiteObject` argument methods are inspected and the public, non static methods
with `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html[TestContext]` parameter are retained and mapped to a Vertx Unit test suite
via the method name:

* `before` : before callback
* `after` : after callback
* `beforeEach` : beforeEach callback
* `afterEach` : afterEach callback
*  when the name starts with _test_ : test case callback named after the method name

.Test suite written using a Java class
[source,java]
----
package examples.junit;

import io.vertx.ext.unit.TestContext;

public class MyTestSuite {

  public void testSomething(TestContext context) {
    context.assertFalse(false);
  }
}
----

This class can be turned into a Vertx test suite easily:

.Create a test suite from a Java object

TestSuite suite = TestSuite.create(new MyTestSuite());

=== Java specific assertions

In Java, the `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html[TestContext]` provides useful extra methods that provides powerful constructs:

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#async_assert_success-instance_method[asyncAssertSuccess]` method returns an `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>`
instance that acts like `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]`, resolving the `Async` on success and failing the test
on failure with the failure cause.

[source,java]
----
Async async = context.async();
vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    async.complete();
  } else {
    context.fail(ar.cause());
  }
});

// Can be replaced by

vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", context.asyncAssertSuccess());
----

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#async_assert_success-instance_method[asyncAssertSuccess]` method returns an `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>`
instance that acts like `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]`, invoking the delegating `Handler<T>` on success
and failing the test on failure with the failure cause.

[source,java]
----
AtomicBoolean started = new AtomicBoolean();
Async async = context.async();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  public void start() throws Exception {
    started.set(true);
  }
}, ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    context.assertTrue(started.get());
    async.complete();
  } else {
    context.fail(ar.cause());
  }
});

// Can be replaced by

vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", context.asyncAssertSuccess(id -> {
  context.assertTrue(started.get());
}));
----

The async is completed when the `Handler` exits, unless new asyncs were created during the invocation, which
can be handy to _chain_ asynchronous behaviors:

[source,java]
----
Async async = context.async();
vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", ar1 -> {
  if (ar1.succeeded()) {
    vertx.deployVerticle("my.otherverticle", ar2 -> {
      if (ar2.succeeded()) {
        async.complete();
      } else {
        context.fail(ar2.cause());
      }
    });
  } else {
    context.fail(ar1.cause());
  }
});

// Can be replaced by

vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", context.asyncAssertSuccess(id ->
        vertx.deployVerticle("my_otherverticle", context.asyncAssertSuccess())
));
----

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#async_assert_failure-instance_method[asyncAssertFailure]` method returns an `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>`
instance that acts like `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]`, resolving the `Async` on failure and failing the test
on success.

[source,java]
----
Async async = context.async();
vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    context.fail();
  } else {
    async.complete();
  }
});

// Can be replaced by

vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", context.asyncAssertFailure());
----

The `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/TestContext.html#async_assert_failure-instance_method[asyncAssertFailure]` method returns an `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>`
instance that acts like `link:../../yardoc/VertxUnit/Async.html[Async]`, invoking the delegating `Handler<Throwable>` on
failure and failing the test on success.

[source,java]
----
Async async = context.async();
vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    context.fail();
  } else {
    context.assertTrue(ar.cause() instanceof IllegalArgumentException);
    async.complete();
  }
});

// Can be replaced by

vertx.deployVerticle("my.verticle", context.asyncAssertFailure(cause -> {
  context.assertTrue(cause instanceof IllegalArgumentException);
}));
----

The async is completed when the `Handler` exits, unless new asyncs were created during the invocation.
